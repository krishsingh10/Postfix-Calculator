# Postfix-Calculator
This project implements a stack data structure using fixed-sized arrays (stack_a.cpp), dynamically-sized arrays (stack_b.cpp), and doubly linked lists (stack_c.cpp). Each implementation efficiently manages memory and supports essential stack operations required for a postfix notation calculator.
